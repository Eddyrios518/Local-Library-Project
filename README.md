# Local-Library-Project

First Thinkful project involving the proper utilization of high order functions, arrow functions, and advanced function concepts.

Assembled the functionality for an application that allows users to search, review and check out books from their local neighborhood.
Created search and sorting functions to allow users to know what books were available and their ratings.

Coded using JavaScript functions that are built to enable the expansion of the library with little to no need for code refactoring.
Technology: JavaScript ES6, Bootstrap, HTML5, Node.js.

Project was implemented for learning and practice purposes. ES6 and Bootstrap training as well. 

Advanced functions are much more concise and quicker to utilize than declaring functions. 

My Goal is to come back and finish the project without outside references and help.

Worked as a team with fellow classmates.
